IMPORTANT: PLEASE DO NOT COPY OR USE THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS AND CODES/FILES; THIS WAS MADE FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT/PROJECT THANK YOU!

Using Javascript, developed a form submission page that checks validity for each submission
Implemented error handling that notifies the user when there are no inputs in the submission or if there are incorrect inputs

For name validation the user must put their first and last name; atleast 1 alphabet is required to complete the field; there can be no non-alpha characters within this field

For email validation, it is checked in the format of `<TEXT>@<TEXT>.<DOMAIN>`

For phone number validation, it is checked to make sure that there are no non numeric values within this field otherwise an error message will be given
